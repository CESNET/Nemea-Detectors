Blacklist Downloader README

   Blacklist Downloader is a python script used to download public blacklists. 
   It periodically fetches IP/URL blacklists, 
   preprocesses them and stores them in files which can be loaded by the detectors.
   The files for the detectors are specified in a configuration file (bld_userConfigFile.xml), along with the
   list of blacklists to download

Usage:
   Just run the script without arguments.
