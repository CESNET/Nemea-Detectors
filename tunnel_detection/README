DNS Tunel Detection README

Goal:	This module detects DNS tunnels on the network.

Input Interface: UniRec format <COLLECTOR_FLOW>,<DNS>
		 Specified by -u parameter
Output Interface: UniRec format <DNS_TUNNEL_ALERT>

Parameters:
    -u TMPL	Specify UniRec template expected on the input interface.
    -p N        Show progess - print a dot every N flows.
    -a          File with whitelist of domain which will not be analysed
    -b          File with whitelist of IPs which will not be analysed
    -c          Read packet from file - MEASURE_PARAMETERS mode
    -s          Folder with results and other information about detection
                (on the end of module). Specify folder for data saving.
    -d          File with results of detection anomaly (during modul runtime).
    -f          Read packets from file
    -g          Set Max and Min EX and VAR for suspision in requests,
                [MIN EX, MAX EX, MIN VAR, MAX VAR] (all values are int) 
    -r          Set Max and Min EX and VAR for suspision in responses,
                [MIN EX, MAX EX, MIN VAR, MAX VAR] (all values are int)
    -j          Set Max count of used letters not to be in suspision mode
                [MAX number for Request, MAX number for response]
    -k          Max and Min percent of subdomain [MAX, MIN]
    -l          Max count and percent of numbers in domain not to be in
                suspicion mode [MAX count, MAX percent]
    -m          Max percent of mallformed packet to be in traffic anoly [MAX]
    -n          MIN count of suspected requests to be traffic anomaly
                or tunnel [MIN for traffic anomaly, MIN for tunnel]
    -o          MIN count of suspected responses to be traffic anomaly or
                tunnel [MIN for traffic anomaly, MIN for tunnel]
    -q          Max and Min percent of searching just ones [MAX, MIN]
    -t          MAX round in SUSPICTION MODE and ATTACK MODE [SUSPICTION, ATTACK]
    -w          MIN length of string to be tunnel [MIN]
    -z          Length of collecting packets berore analysis in sec [time in sec]
