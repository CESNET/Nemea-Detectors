Blacklist Downloader README

   Blacklist Downloader is set of functions used to download website content
using GNU wget utility. It is initialized by special structure, containing types
of blacklists to use and how to handle them. After initialization a new thread is created,
which will periodically download contents of specified blacklists, process them and then
signal main thread to update its blacklist list with this new one.

Usage:
   Modul which want to use Blacklist Downloader will first call function:
      bl_down_init(bl_struct);
   Where bl_struct is structure with arguments for blacklist download

   Function will then return 1 if succeed, otherwise it returns value < 0.
   If succeed, main thread will be signaled if new update is ready.
