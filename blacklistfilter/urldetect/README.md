# URL blacklistfilter

## Goal	

Module receives the UniRec HTTP flow records and checks if the HTTP PATH (`HTTP_HOST` + `HTTP_URL`) is present in any 
blacklist that are available. If any of the addresses is 
blacklisted, the record is changed by adding a number/index of 
the blacklists that contain this URL. UniRec with this 
flag is then sent to the output interface. Blacklists are downloaded by a separate module
`bl_downloader.py` which saves blacklists to a file (specified in configuration) and blacklistfilter uses
this file to reload blacklists.

## Input/Output

Input Interface: UniRec format (`<HTTP_FLOW>`)

Output Interface: UniRec format (`<HTTP_FLOW>`, `BLACKLIST`)

## Usage

```
Usage:	./urlblacklistfilter -u <config_file> -i <trap_interface>
```

# Blacklist downloader

URL blacklistfilter uses blacklist file which is handled by Python downloader (bl_downloader.py).
The downloader periodically checks for new blacklist updates and feeds it to the blacklistfilter
using inotify mechanism. The data are preprocessed by the downloader (sorted, trimmed whitespaces etc.)

See "TODO: downloader README ref"


## Required data

This module is implemented on TRAP platform, so it receives data on
TRAP input interface in UniRec format.

UniRec fields required:

- `DST_IP` (ipaddr): destination IP address of the flow
- `SRC_IP` (ipaddr): source IP address of the flow
- `DST_PORT` (uint16): destination port of the flow
- `SRC_PORT` (uint16): source port of the flow
- `TIME_FIRST` (time): time of the first packet in the flow
- `TIME_LAST` (time): time of the last packet in the flow
- `HTTP_HOST` (string): HTTP Host header
- `HTTP_REFERER` (string): HTTP Referer header
- `HTTP_URL` (string): HTTP URL


## Output data

Upon detection, the input data are sent to the output, enriched with this value:

- `BLACKLIST` (uint64): indexes of the blacklists (bitmap) which blacklisted the URL

## Compilation and linking

This module requires compilation with `-std=c++11`, because of the usage of *std::vector, streams, etc.*.

For linking add `-ltrap -lunirec -lnemea-common`
(the module must be compiled as a part of [NEMEA](https://github.com/CESNET/Nemea) repository or using installed libtrap-devel and unirec packages).
