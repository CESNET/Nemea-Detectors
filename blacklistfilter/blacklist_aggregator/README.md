# Blacklist aggregator

Blacklist aggregator receives IP and URL detection flows from blacklist detectors and aggregates them in a time window.
(DNS detection is not aggregated and goes straight to the Adaptive filter, this is explained in the main [README](../README.md)).
Output of IP detector is pre-aggregated with the [Universal aggregator](https://github.com/CESNET/Nemea-Modules/tree/master/aggregator). 
Records are being aggregated 1:N in time window, where 1 is the blacklisted entry, N are the clients who communicated with it.

## Usage:

```
Usage:	blacklist_aggregator.py -i <trap_interface> [-t <minutes>]
```

## Operation
- Modules receives IP flows (first interface) and URL flows (second interface)
- Default aggregation time window is 5 minutes, after this timeout, the aggregated events are sent to the output interface
- Index of the blacklist is split if containing more blacklists (when entity is on two and more blacklists, 
there is an aggregated event for each)
- Ports are listed only when < 49152
- Maximum target IPs is 1000 (if more, the list is trimmed) 
- Aggregation keys are as follows:
    - IP:
        - IP address of the blacklisted entity
        - IP protocol (6 - TCP, 17 - UDP, ..)
        - index of the blacklist where entity is listed (only one blacklist index)
    - URL:
        - HTTP Request host
        - HTTP Request URL
        - Destination IP address
        - IP protocol (6 - TCP, 17 - UDP, ..)
        - index of the blacklist where entity is listed (only one blacklist index)


## Fields
- **type**: _ip_ or _url_
- **ts_first**: first flow timestamp in agg window
- **ts_last**: last flow timestamp in agg window
- **protocol**: 6, 17 etc.
- **source/source_url/source_ip**: "source of trouble", the blacklisted entity
- **source_ports**: list of ports used by the blacklisted entity
- **targets**: IP list of the clients which communicated with the blacklisted entity
- **src_sent_\***: Bytes/flows/packets sent by the source of trouble (blacklisted entity)
- **dst_sent_\***: Bytes/flows/packets sent by the clients
- **blacklist_id**: bitmap ID of the blacklist 
- **agg_win_minutes**: Aggregation window in minutes (can be float)

- **referer**: HTTP Referer
- **is_only_fqdn**: boolean whether its only FQDN or the entire URL (with HTTP_PATH)


## Pre-aggregation
The data from IP detector are preaggregated with the universal aggregator. This is mainly because of performance.
The pre-aggregation of the IP traffic is done using these params:
- key: SRC_IP, DST_IP, PROTOCOL, DST_PORT
- sum: BYTES, PACKETS,
- or: SRC_BLACKLIST, DST_BLACKLIST

## IP Example input

IP addresses are anonymized.

## URL Example output
Things to notice:
- `029999.com` appears twice, that's because it's on two blacklists.
- `www.zstresser.com` and `zstresser.com` are treated the same
