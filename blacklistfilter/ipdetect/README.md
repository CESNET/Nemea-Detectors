# IP blacklistfilter

## Goal

Module receives the UniRec basic flow and checks if the stored source
address or destination address is present in any 
blacklist that are available. If any of the addresses is 
blacklisted, the record is changed by adding a number/index of 
the blacklists that contain this address. UniRec with this 
flag is then sent to the output interface. Blacklists are downloaded by a separate module
bl_downloader.py which saves blacklists to a file (specified in configuration) and blacklistfilter uses
this file to reload blacklists.

## Input/Output

Input Interface: UniRec format (<BASIC_FLOW>)
Output Interface: UniRec format (<BASIC_FLOW>,SRC_BLACKLIST,DST_BLACKLIST)

## Usage

```
Usage:	./ipblacklistfilter -u <config_file> -i <trap_interface>
```

# Blacklist downloader

IP blacklistfilter uses blacklist file which is handled by Python downloader (bl_downloader.py).
The downloader periodically checks for new blacklist updates and feeds it to the blacklistfilter
using inotify mechanism. The data are preprocessed by the downloader (sorted, trimmed whitespaces etc.)

See "TODO: downloader README ref"


## Required data

This module is implemented on TRAP platform, so it receives data on
TRAP input interface in UniRec format.

UniRec fields required:

- `DST_IP` (ipaddr): destination IP address of the flow
- `SRC_IP` (ipaddr): source IP address of the flow
- `DST_PORT` (uint16): destination port of the flow
- `SRC_PORT` (uint16): source port of the flow
- `PROTOCOL` (uint8): protocol used (TCP, UDP...)
- `PACKETS` (uint32): packets in the flow
- `BYTES` (uint32): bytes in the flow
- `TIME_FIRST` (time): time of the first packet in the flow
- `TIME_LAST` (time): time of the last packet in the flow

## Output data

Upon detection, the input data are sent to the output, enriched with these values:

- `DST_BLACKLIST` (uint64): indexes of the blacklists (bitmap) which blacklisted `DST_IP`, zero if not blacklisted
- `SRC_BLACKLIST` (uint64): indexes of the blacklists (bitmap) which blacklisted `SRC_IP`, zero if not blacklisted

## Compilation and linking

This module requires compilation with `-std=c++11`, because of the usage of *std::vector, streams, etc.*.

For linking add `-ltrap -lunirec -lnemea-common`
(the module must be compiled as a part of [NEMEA](https://github.com/CESNET/Nemea) repository or using installed libtrap-devel and unirec packages).
