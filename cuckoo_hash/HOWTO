Short howto for hashing table with cuckoo hashing.

First initialize the table by using ht_init function.
This function creates the table based on supplied parameters which are 
size of the table, size of the data that will be stored within each item 
(sizeof(*datatype*) and length of the key that will be used for accessing 
the items.

    For inserting the item use the ht_insert() function which you need to 
supply with the hash table you want to insert the item in, key to the data 
and the data you want to insert.

    You can get the data using the ht_get() function or an index for the 
item with ht_get_index(). Both functions need only table and key as parameter.
Item can be removed in similar way by using ht_remove_by_key() procedure which 
needs same parameters as the "getters" or by using ht_remove_by_index function 
which uses index to the item instead of key.

    Before exiting the program use the ht_destroy() procedure to free any memory 
used by the hash table.
