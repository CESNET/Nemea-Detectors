=============================
== HostStats Installation  ==
=============================

HostStats consists of main program "hoststatserv" running as a daemon,
NfSen backend pluign, which notifies HostStats about new data, and NfSen
frontend plugin, which visualizes computed host statistics.

To install both program and NfSen plugins, run:
  
  ./install.sh 

This script copy the program, configuration files and auxiliary scripts to
a specified location, creates directories for data files and installs backend 
and frontend flugins to their locations according to your nfsen configuration.


== Configuration ==

After files are installed, you need to set up configuration in hoststats.conf
file (default location is /usr/local/hoststats/hoststats.conf).
It's necessary to set up at least path to netflow data (flow-data-path),
and names of flow sources and their priorities (flow-sources).

Flow records from sources with the same priority are merged (i.e. counters of
flows with the same key are summed up), records from sources with different 
priorities are deduplicated (i.e. when two flows with the same key are found,
one of them is dropped) keeping the record from the source with lower priority.


== Uninstallation ==

Just remove all files from installation path (default: /usr/local/hoststats/)
and data path (default: /data/hoststats/) and uninstall frontend and backend 
NfSen plugin (their location depends on your NfSen configuration).
